# culturalwasteland.github.io

  ## Brief overview
This was mainly created for [culturalwasteland.neocities.org](culturalwasteland.neocities.org)

## + Details I suppose
This project is a somewhat hardfork of https://paracks342.github.io/yumenikki/ .  
That is: in the sense that it currently is only hosting yume nikki and I could not generate the correct version of yume nikki to be played through the [EasyRPG web player](https://wiki.easyrpg.org/development/player/web).  
The goal is to add more free games, eventually. Mainly on the aesthetic that fits on [culturalwasteland.neocities.org](culturalwasteland.neocities.org) (.flow and whatnot).   
I was looking forward for hosting this over there, however, due to restrictions in upload types on Neocities that allows only paying members to upload (mainly web assembly files, which EasyRPG uses for its emulator), I shifted my focus to github pages :D .  

Anyway, that's it for now.  
Thanks!
